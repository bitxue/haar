Matlab examples implimenting a nd-haar transform and it's inverse.

One dimensional versions provide slightly easier to read demonstrations of the
basic algorithm.

These were written as proof-of-concept code so I could figure out how I wanted
to put the c code together.

Tested on images and 1d functions.  Limited testing on higher dimensional
things.

Input must have power-of-2 dimensions.  Dimensions do not need to be equal.
